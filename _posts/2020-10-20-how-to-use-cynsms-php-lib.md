# Getting started

This Api is meant for 3rd party integrations

## How to Build

The generated code has dependencies over external libraries like UniRest. These dependencies are defined in the ```composer.json``` file that comes with the SDK. 
To resolve these dependencies, we use the Composer package manager which requires PHP greater than 5.3.2 installed in your system. 
Visit [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to download the installer file for Composer and run it in your system. 
Open command prompt and type ```composer --version```. This should display the current version of the Composer installed if the installation was successful.

* Using command line, navigate to the directory containing the generated files (including ```composer.json```) for the SDK. 
* Run the command ```composer install```. This should install all the required dependencies and create the ```vendor``` directory in your project directory.
